1. Make a switchable Code Area Sidebar with rename, delete, delete all (except top), also with a
   and when exporting mod zip, generate seperate .lua files for each code area like apple.lua and banana.lua
   and at ./src/ and make a main.lua (at ./) which loads all of them

2. make a way to import code > blocks (does not reset project, just adds it on top) only if valid, like if it can be made with the blocks
   example: you input:
   ```
   if #G.hand.cards > 0 then

   end
   ```
   it'll add the if block and then a compare block, switch the operator 
   to '>' and add a text_value block on the right with '0' as the text_value
   and then a card_amt block on the left side of the comparator with the option to "(Amount of) Cards in Hand"
