I'm tryna make an intuitive, interesting, and easy way to create Balatro Mods without touching any Lua code at all!

If you wanna try it out, you can mess around with it right [here](https://ch3rryc0d3r.github.io/joker-blocks/). I update it basically every day.
Got suggestions? Drop ‘em in the [Suggestions Forum](https://discord.com/channels/1434189284511973518/1434198481572204804) on my Discord server!

With this simple block-coding approach we can recreate complex mechanics, like Ceremonial Dagger's `Destroy Joker to the Right` system, with only 4 blocks!

We can also recreate `Perkeo`'s `Create Negative Copy of a random consumeable` system very easily, with only 4 blocks (lol another `4 blocks`)
